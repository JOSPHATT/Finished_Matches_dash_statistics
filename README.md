# Finished Matches Dashboard Statistics

This repository provides tools to process football match statistics and visualize the results interactively. It includes two main components:
1. **Data Processing Script (`main.py`)**: Prepares and generates team statistics from raw data.
2. **Streamlit Dashboard (`streamlit_main.py`)**: Provides an interactive dashboard to explore and visualize team statistics.

## Features

### Data Processing (`main.py`)
- Fetches raw football match data from a remote URL.
- Cleans and preprocesses the data, handling missing values and duplicates.
- Calculates key team statistics, including:
  - Matches played, won, drawn, and lost
  - Goals scored, conceded, and goal difference
  - Win rate, draw rate, and loss rate
  - Scoring strength (a custom metric combining goals scored and goal difference)
- Saves the processed statistics to a CSV file (`team_statistics.csv`).

### Streamlit Dashboard (`streamlit_main.py`)
- Loads team statistics from `team_statistics.csv`.
- Allows users to filter data by team or view the top 15 teams based on matches played.
- Provides interactive charts, including:
  - Bar charts
  - Line charts
  - Scatter plots
- Enables customization of chart types and statistics to visualize.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JOSPHATT/Finished_Matches_dash_statistics.git
   cd Finished_Matches_dash_statistics
   ```

2. Install the required Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure that the raw data URL in `main.py` is accessible and points to a valid CSV file.

## Usage

### Step 1: Generate Team Statistics
Run the `main.py` script to fetch and process raw data into the `team_statistics.csv` file:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 2: Start the Streamlit Dashboard
Launch the dashboard to visualize the team statistics:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_main.py
```

### Step 3: Explore the Dashboard
- Use the sidebar to filter by team or select custom chart options.
- View detailed statistics and charts for the top 15 teams.

## File Descriptions

### `main.py`
This script handles data fetching, cleaning, processing, and saving team statistics. Key steps include:
1. Reading raw football match data from a remote URL.
2. Cleaning the data (removing duplicates, handling missing values).
3. Calculating team-level metrics for home and away matches.
4. Merging home and away stats into a single dataset.
5. Saving the final dataset to `team_statistics.csv`.

### `streamlit_main.py`
This script creates an interactive Streamlit dashboard for visualizing team statistics. Features include:
1. Loading the processed `team_statistics.csv` file.
2. Displaying filtered data in a table format.
3. Providing customization options for chart types and statistics.
4. Generating interactive charts using Plotly.

## Example Workflow

1. Run `main.py` to generate the `team_statistics.csv` file.
2. Start the Streamlit dashboard with `streamlit_main.py`.
3. Use the dashboard to explore team statistics and visualize key metrics.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pandas
- Streamlit
- Plotly

Install all dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the raw data URL in `main.py` is valid and accessible.
- The `team_statistics.csv` file must be generated by running `main.py` before using the dashboard.
